# Data-Management
A simple renaming tool for production and dailies workflows, inspired by Netflix’s best practices.
## What It Does
This app enforces consistent, unique naming for Original Camera Files (OCF), Original Audio Files (OAF), and dailies outputs—eliminating duplicate filenames that can disrupt post-production.
## How to Use
1.Select the folder containing your OCF, OAF, and dailies files.
2.Customize your naming system using the template: [cameraRoll]_[originalClipName]_[shootDate-YYMMDD]
(Example: C1R1_Clip001_240821 for Camera Roll 1, Clip 001, shot on August 21, 2024)
3.Click "Preview" to review proposed name changes.
4.Click "Rename Files" to finalize renaming.
## Note
Always create a backup of your original OCF/OAF before using the app. This ensures you retain unmodified source files in case of errors.
